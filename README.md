This is a back up file I made for my unity project in portable SSD, it is located in the desktop. Here I want to make some changes:
- Glow on character
- background drawn out
- lighting assets drawn out( animation) 
- moving traps
- magic circle
- keys collected using boolean
- how to jump more than one block ( for level 1)
- THE ENDING coffin
- Dialogue?
- story items ( lets keep it in the coffin) 
- secret code items
-
